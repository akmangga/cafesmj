      <h3>Chef JOEY Jr</h3>
      <p>Head Chef of Cafe SMJ SMM ABC</p>
    </div>
<p>One day, Joey was enjoying some delicious Sabahan food at a small local stall. As he savored every bite, he realized how food had the power to bring people together to share stories, laughter, and comfort. That moment sparked an idea: What if there was a place where people could enjoy that same warmth and connection, but through coffee and homemade treats?

Joey shared the idea with his friends, and soon, everyone was excited to make it happen. Each person brought something special one loved brewing coffee, another enjoyed baking, and another had a passion for creating cozy spaces. Together, they decided to open a café that blended local inspiration with a modern, welcoming atmosphere.

Their goal was simple: to create a spot where people could relax, enjoy good food and drinks, and feel at home. From that single moment of enjoying Sabahan food, the dream of their café began built on friendship, creativity, and the joy of sharing flavors with others.
